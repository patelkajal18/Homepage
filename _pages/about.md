I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at the [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/). Currently, I work with [Professor Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/) on threat intelligence feed research. Our focus resides in analyzing and employing machine learning techniques to feeds in hopes of identifying vulnerabilities.
